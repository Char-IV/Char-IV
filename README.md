Hello! I am Char IV, a student at Maryville University of St. Louis.
I have experience in C++, Java, Python, and SQL, and am going into the artificial intelligence and data science branches of computer science.
I enjoy playing and working on video games in my free time, usually in Godot 4.
Always looking to learn as much as possible, and have fun while doing it.
